# (WIP) Matter RGB lamp

**NOTE** This project is still very much a playground.

This projects builds a Matter enabled RGB lamp.

The current purpose of this project is to understand the user experience of the 
Rust implementation of Matter (`rs-matter`) and identify pain points for future 
improvement of `rs-matter`. 
The secondary purpose of this project is to build a cheap Matter enabled floor lamp 
for my bedroom.
